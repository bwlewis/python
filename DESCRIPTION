Description: TensorFlow is an open source software library for
  numerical computation using data flow graphs. Nodes in the
  graph represent mathematical operations, while the graph edges
  represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors) communicated
  between them. The flexible architecture allows you to deploy
  computation to one or more CPUs or GPUs in a desktop, server, or
  mobile device with a single API. TensorFlow was originally developed
  by researchers and engineers working on the Google Brain Team within
  Google's Machine Intelligence research organization for the purposes
  of conducting machine learning and deep neural networks research,
  but the system is general enough to be applicable in a wide variety
  of other domains as well.
